# Fast-Matrix-Computation

## Project Description

Fast-Matrix-Computation is a bibliteka written in C++ that implements operations on matrices: addition, subtraction, inversion, multiplication, transpose
It was implemented as part of a competition that managed to improve the performance of these operations by more than 300 times over a naive implementation
